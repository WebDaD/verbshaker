## What is a Verbshaker?
This is simple:
We found out, that in many languages, proverbs consist of two halfes. If you mixe them up, the result can be pretty nice and funny

# MASTER
This is the master-Branch.
For other Branches, see [Links above](#list-of-branches)

[Demo is running here](http://)

## Install and Start the App

### OneLiner
1. `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebDaD/verbshaker/master/install.sh | sh`

### Native
1. `git clone https://github.com/WebDaD/verbshaker.git`
2. `cd verbshaker`
3. `npm run deploy`
4. `npm start`

### Docker
1. `git clone https://github.com/WebDaD/verbshaker.git`
2. `cd verbshaker`
3. `docker build -t verbshaker .`
4. `docker run verbshaker`

## Edit the config
The configuration is found in `package.json`  
To change it, simply edit the values and then restart the app via `npm run restart`  
_Example Config_:
```json
"config": {
	"port":8080,
	"proverbs":"proverbs/",
	"show_docs":true
}
```
* **port**: the Web-Port where the app will be found
* **proverbs**: The path where the csv-files with the proverbs live
* **show_docs**: if set to false, the docs-path will not be avaiable (good for production)

## Testing / docs
Testing is done automatically during deploy.  
You may see the Results at `http://<server>:<port>/docs`
