A cat;may look at a king
A chain;is only as strong as its weakest link
A change;is as good as a rest
A dog;is a man's best friend
A drowning man;will clutch at a straw
A fish always;rots from the head down
A fool and his money;are soon parted
A friend in need;is a friend indeed
A golden key;can open any door
A good beginning;makes a good ending
A good man;is hard to find
A house divided against itself;cannot stand
A house;is not a home
A journey of a thousand miles;begins with a single step
A leopard;cannot change its spots
Two wrongs;don't make a right
The pen;is mightier than the sword
When in Rome;do as the Romans
The squeaky wheel;gets the grease
No man;is an island
Fortune;favors the bold
People who live in glass houses should not;throw stones
Birds of a feather;flock together
A picture;is worth a thousand words
The early bird;catches the worm
Practice;makes perfect.
A man;is as old as he feels.
An idle brain;is the devil's workshop
An ounce of discretion;is worth a pound of wit
Every cloud;has a silver lining
A great talker;is a great liar
All that glitters;is not gold
Every dog;has its day
Habit;is second nature
Great haste;makes great waste
No news;is good news
One man's meat;is another man's poison
A bad workman always;blames his tools
Half a loaf;is better than none
The sky;is the limit
Money;is the root of all evil
One swallow;doesn't make a summer
A miss;is as good as a mile
An apple a day;keeps the doctor away
The devil;has the best tunes
